        I am a Undergraduate Student at Towson University, majoring in Computer Science with a track in Software Engineering. 
        I has experience in many areas of computer science, including Front and Back-End development, as well as many leadership 
        and teaching roles within the discipline. Since my first computer science class at Arundel High School, I have been 
        coding and have excelled in my academics. I love the challenge computer science has to offer in addition to the creativity 
        needed to develop and build applications.

          A telltale sign of a good developer is one that focuses on the needs and wants of the end user and stakeholders, a 
          person who focuses on the usability and efficiency of the product.  I believe without that mindset then the product 
          wonâ€™t be the best it can possibly be.  Whether your website is a simple e-commerce application or a complex multimedia 
          application, my absolute best should be put into your website.

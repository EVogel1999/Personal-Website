                Emily is an Undergraduate Student at Towson University, 
                majoring in Computer Science with a track in Software 
                Engineering. She has experience in many areas of computer 
                science, including Front and Back-End work, as well as a 
                teaching assistant in an introductory computer science 
                course. Emily has been coding since her first computer 
                science class at Arundel High School and has excelled since 
                then in her academics. She loves the challenge computer 
                science has to offer in addition to the creativity needed
